                    What does Sanatana Dhanam mean?
                    Sanatana Dhanam is the wealth that will be with you forever. It removes all evil from your life, and bestows great benefits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What do I need to know?
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Go to Sanatanadhanam.org
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fill in your details (name, email address, etc.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Submit
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Then, you will get an email with a link that directs you straight to your personal video which is approximately 90sec long. There will be a few important notifications that suggest you to subscribe to gattu’s karishye vachanam thava YouTube channel.

                    There will be 3 slokas included in the video which you must chant everyday, without fail, at your most convenient time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How long must I continue?
                    Life-long
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are the benefits I can get from doing this daily?
                    You get the same benefits that are equivalent to when one reads the entire Ramayanam once (24,000 slokas), Vishnusahasranamam 24 times (1,000 times), and the Bhagavat Gita 33 times (700 slokas).
                </li>
                <li>
                    How is it possible to get the same benefits?
                    Everyone will receive one slokam from the Bhagavat Gita, Ramayanam, and one namam from the Vishnusahasranamam. As a member of a family consisted of 24,000 people, you will receive the added benefits of everyone chanting their own individual slokas which will add up to chanting the Ramayanam once, Vishnusahasranamam 24 times, and the Bhagavad Gita 33 times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Will I be able to chant properly?
                    In the video, the slokas will be separated into small bits so you can repeat easily. It will only take a few days to master the slokas. Once mastered, it will take approximately 30 sec to chant daily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What if I don’t chant every day?
                    Is it that difficult to spend 30sec daily for the benefit of you, your immediate family, and your 24,000 member family?
                    Your family of 24,000 people are counting on you to do your part!
                </li>
                <li>
                    What should I do during the days I’m not supposed to chant (monthly cycles, etc.)?
                    Simply listen to it or read it in your mind.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Why only these 3 slokas?
                    Because, all Acharyas have collectively agreed on the importance of these. So, it is our responsibility to preserve and pass on to the future generations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How many people will you distribute these to?
                    It will be a continuous process until it reaches to all members of the Sanatana Dharma.
                    As everyone chants their individual slokas, we can collectively help the world get its peace (Loka Kalyanam).
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are the special benefits of the three slokas?
                    Ramayanam: All sins will be burnt into ashes.
                    Bhagavad Gita: You will be successful in all your endeavors.
                    Vishnusahasranamam: You will thoroughly enjoy your success.
                </li>
            </ol>
            Finally: Your guru, family god, favorite god, ancestors, all devathas, and Srimannarayana will be very happy from this small but great effort of yours!
